					<p>I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student from University of Toronto and a hockey enthusiast, currently in my third year. I have spent most of my life in Hong Kong, having attended elementary and high-school there. As an engineer, I love to understand the world in a more practical point of view and improve it by developing and designing ideas. Whether it is circuitary or software, I love to understand how the world has become so dependent on electronics- hence to this day, I am still indecisive whether I am a electrical or computer engineer
					
					<p>This site was developed to apply my HTML, CSS and as a foundation for web development during my free time

					<p>As the world is full of mysteries, here are my interests
					<p><b>Academic: </b>Electrical engineering- circuits (analog and digital) and control; Computer engineering- networks
					
					<p><b>Outside of Class: </b>Circuits and Robotics(Academic); Programming and Web development(Personal)
					<p>Scroll down below to see a summary of the projects and courses I have done am doing (and click on the links) to find out more!

					As a student full of creativity and curioistiy, I am interested in learning and applying knowledge that I have learnt As an engineering student, this means developing a product and going through the design process- planning, building and debugging. Whenever I have time, my goal is to work on projects involving both software and hardware. 

					<p><b>Software:</b> my goal is to improve my understanding of web and server scripting (HTML, CSS and Javascript and PHP); and to become familiar with common libraries such as GTK. Software projects include: Website development- both desktop and mobile; and GUI software development
					<br>My mobile website (currently under development)</a> 

					<p><b>Hardware:</b> my goal is to improve my application of hardware (muxes, RAM, etc) and to become familiar and apply concepts of electrical components. Hardware projects involve: a simple game utilizing a DE2 board; and basic understanding of common circuits with Arduino

					As an engineering student, I am interested in designing and creating products. Currently I am executive invovled in 2 design clubs: Spark and University of Toronto Robotics Association. My goal is to gain exposure to circuitary and micro-controllers while applying the skills and knowledge into ideas
					
					<p><b>Areas of Interest: </b>circuits and robotics
					<p><b>Extra-curriculars: </b>Spark, UTRA, Intramurals (Hockey and Volleyball)

				<div>
					My resume is available in both HTML and PDF format. Currently I am planning to do PEY and applying for jobs. As a creative engineer, I love jobs involving creativity, designing and building from the bottom to the top! 

					<p><b>Summer 2014 : </b>I was a research assistant under Professor W.T. Ng from the VLSI group. My goal is to familarize myself with CAD software used in PCB design and have a better understand of the datashet for compoennts

					<p>I have previous work experience with Standard Chartered Bank and YMCA Camping. In additional, I have developed personal and technical skills from undergraduate courses, such as using IDEs and C/C++. Currently I am trying to improve on my programming langauge skills.
