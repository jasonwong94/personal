			<h1>Skule Life + Extra Curriculars</h1>
				<summary>
				<h2>Involved with Spark (Design Club), UTRA and part of the Undergraduate Research Day Commitee (UnERD)</h2>

		
				<p>As an engineering student, I try to balance out between my social and academic life. As a student interested who enjoys creating and designing products and even playing sports, I like to join clubs that involve my creativity and thinking skills. As the courses I take in upper years become more interesting, I hope that I will be able to contribute more towards the clubs. 

				<p>From these extra-curriculars, I have met new people of different background, engineering disciplines and event art-scis. Most importantly, I learnt how to work as a team regardless of the skill and knowledge level of different members, learning new skills from them and teaching them other skills. During my first 2 years, I have been involved in some clubs due to my personal interests. While I struggled academically as froshie (1st year) adjusting into the university environment, I hope that in the coming years I will be able to participate in more engineering-related clubs

					<h3>UnERD</h3>
					<aside>
						<h4>Logistics Director</h4>
						<p>This annual event is for undergraduate engineering research summer students to showcase their work. Students presented their work either as a presentation (held in lecture rooms) or as a poster (presented at the atrium). Working alongside with other students in the  commitee, I was in charge of dealing with scheduling and resource management for the day, which included: room assignments for judges and participants, posterboard layout and catering.

						<p>In addition to my logistical responsibility, I also contributed in creating the front cover of the booklet as well as creating posters to advertise the event.

						<p>This year's UnERD 2014 managed to reach out to 100+ participants of different engineering categories and interests. For more information visit unerd.skule.ca

					<h3>UTRA</h3>
					<aside>
					<h4>RepRap (3D printing) and Combat Vehicle</h4> 
					<p>In RepRap, we designed and built a fume cupboard to contain the fumes produced by the printer. In addtion, we conducted diagnostic checks on the printer to see whether the printer had any issues printing objects. This up coming year, I am hoping to be involved in the construction of a new, multi-colour 3D printer.

					<p>In Combat, I created a circuit consisting of LEDs for aesthetic reasons. The circuit involved voltage regulators, resistors and LEDs as components. Several prototypes were done to adjust the LED brightness. This coming year, I hope to improve on the system and utilize arduino to add cooler effects.

					<h3>Spark</h3>

					<h4>Webmaster and Marketing</h4>
					Having joined the Spark Team for the 1T4-1T5 year, my goal is to become more familiar with engineering design and creativity. With brainstorming underway for F!rosh week 1T4, I believe this will be one of the best clubs I have ever committed.

					<p>Finally, as a designated Spark webmaster, I hope to improve and spread Spark's image across the whole Skule network. My goal is to improve on website design and content, plus develop a mobile version of the website

					<h4>Hockey and Volleyball</h4>
					<p>Ever since I started playing hockey in HK, my passion for hockey has grown. Although I play for an Art-Sci team, I have enjoyed playing with non-engineering teammates. During my free time, I shoot pucks on the driveway, do some stickhandling drills and watch some hockey games. During 1T3-1T4, I was invovled with the Skule vs. Campus Police game 

					<p>I started playing volleyball in a co-ed team starting in 2014 as an interest in learning a new sport
